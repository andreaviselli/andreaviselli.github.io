## 📖 Research interests

My research interests include forecast evaluation, forecasting models & methods, and structural analysis in macroeconomics and energy. 

In particular, I am currently interested in the following topics:
- **Forecast evaluation:** statistical tests of predictive ability and performance evaluation metrics.
- **Forecast combinations:** frequentist and Bayesian combination methods, and the explanaibility of component forecasts for economic communication.

I am also eager to work on the following areas:
- **Probabilistic programming:** bridging probabilistic programming languagues and econometrics for applications in economic forecasting and structural analysis.
- **Alternative data:** text data & large language models for economic forecasting and risk measurement.
