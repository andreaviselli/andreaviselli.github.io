I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Economics, Management, and Quantitative Methods](https://demm.unimi.it/it) of the University of Milan. I have a PhD in Economics from the [University of Milan & University of Pavia](https://www.phdeconomics.unimi.it/). I defended my doctoral thesis in February 2025.
