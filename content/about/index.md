I am currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Milan & University of Pavia. 

I am interested in econometric methods, both in the frequentist and Bayesian realms of statistics, for policy analysis and forecasting. I have been working with big, mixed-frequency data for nowcasting macroeconomic activity, high-frequency energy prices to forecast spot electricity prices, and with statistical tests of predictive ability and structural breaks.

I am exploring machine learning methods and, in general, applications of AI to economics. In particular, I am working with large language models (LLM) for content analysis and macroeconomic forecasting, and with probabilistic programming languages (PPM) for automatic inference.
