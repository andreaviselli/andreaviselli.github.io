## 💻 Bio (short)

I am currently working as a Teaching Assistant at the [Faculty of Economics and Management](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/economics-management/) of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, where I support courses in Econometrics and Statistics for Economics.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Department of Economics, Management, and Quantitative Methods](https://demm.unimi.it/it) at the University of Milan. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics jointly awarded by the [University of Milan and the University of Pavia](https://www.phdeconomics.unimi.it/) in February 2025.

## 📖 Research interests

My research interests include forecast evaluation, forecasting models & methods, and structural analysis in macroeconomics and energy. 

In particular, I am currently interested in the following topics:
- **Forecast evaluation:** predictive ability tests and performance metrics using alternative loss functions; testing in the presence of weak signal in the forecasting variable.
- **Forecast combinations:** frequentist and Bayesian combination methods, and the explanaibility of component forecasts for economic communication (e.g., central banks).
- **Structural analysis:** structural vector autoregressive models for the empirical analysis of electricity and energy markets and their interconnections with the macroeconomy, with a strong emphasis on policy.
- **Probabilistic programming:** bridging probabilistic programming languagues and econometrics for applications in economic forecasting and structural analysis.
- **Alternative data:** text data & large language models for economic forecasting and risk measurement.
