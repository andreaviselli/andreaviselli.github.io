I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Economics, Management, and Quantitative Methods](https://demm.unimi.it/it) at the University of Milan. I hold a PhD in Economics from the [University of Milan and University of Pavia](https://www.phdeconomics.unimi.it/), awarded in February 2025.

My research interests include forecast evaluation, forecasting methods, and causal inference in macro/energy. Some of my specific areas of focus are:
- **Forecast evaluation:** Considering tests with alternative loss functions, evaluating performance in the presence of weak signal, and reviewing applied studies.
- **Forecast combinations:** Developing classical and Bayesian techniques to combine a diverse set of forecasts/forecasting methods.
- **Causal inference:** Using structural models to analyze energy markets and their connections with the macroeconomy, with a strong emphasis on policy.
- **Probabilistic programming:** Exploring its application for modern time series analysis, forecasting, and causal inference.
- **Alternative data:** Leveraging text data and other novel data sources for forecasting and risk measurement.
I am always open to exploring interesting and challenging research questions, particularly those with a vision and strong technological potential.
