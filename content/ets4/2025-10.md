[Link to working paper ↗](https://d.repec.org/n?u=RePEc:arx:papers:2510.04357&r=&r=for)

- **Authors:** Anoushka Harit, Zhongtian Sun, Jongmin Yu
- **Source:** NEP-FOR (2025-10-21)
- **Summary:** The paper introduces the Causal Sphere Hypergraph Transformer (CSHT), a novel architecture designed for financial time-series forecasting that integrates Granger-causal hypergraph structures with Riemannian geometry and causally masked Transformer attention. This approach models the directional influence of financial news and sentiment on asset returns, providing robust generalization across market regimes and transparent attribution pathways from macroeconomic events to stock-level responses. The CSHT demonstrates superior performance in return prediction, regime classification, and asset ranking tasks, indicating its potential as a practical solution for forecasting under uncertainty.

## Parsing the pulse: decomposing macroeconomic sentiment with LLMs
[Link to working paper ↗](https://d.repec.org/n?u=RePEc:bis:biswps:1294&r=&r=for)

- **Authors:** Byeungchun Kwon, Taejin Park, Phurichai Rungcharoenkitkul, Frank Smets
- **Source:** NEP-FOR (2025-10-21)
- **Summary:** This paper introduces a novel approach to forecasting macroeconomic indicators by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to parse press narratives and extract sentiment indices related to growth and inflation. The authors demonstrate that these sentiment indices closely track traditional hard data and improve the forecasting performance of existing statistical models by incorporating information that is not captured by conventional datasets. The ability to decompose sentiment into its drivers—demand, supply, and structural forces—provides a deeper understanding of macroeconomic dynamics, enhancing predictive accuracy in real-time economic assessments.

## Signature-Informed Transformer for Asset Allocation
[Link to working paper ↗](https://d.repec.org/n?u=RePEc:arx:papers:2510.03129&r=&r=for)

- **Authors:** Yoontae Hwang, Stefan Zohren
- **Source:** NEP-FOR (2025-10-21)
- **Summary:** The paper introduces the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel framework for asset allocation that directly optimizes a risk-aware financial objective, addressing the shortcomings of traditional deep-learning forecasters. Its innovative use of path signatures provides a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics, while the signature-augmented attention mechanism incorporates financial inductive biases, such as lead-lag effects. Evaluated on S&P 100 equity data, SIT significantly outperforms existing models, indicating its potential for enhancing predictive accuracy in financial decision-making.

It introduces a novel custom loss function that combines Mean Absolute Error, Jensen-Shannon Divergence, and a smoothness penalty to enhance prediction accuracy. The model's online learning approach allows it to adapt to new data incrementally, improving its performance and reducing prediction error, particularly during peak demand periods. The integration of various features, including historical prices and weather conditions, further strengthens its forecasting capabilities.

- **Summary:** This paper presents a novel approach to macroeconomic forecasting by integrating high-dimensional data with regularization techniques, rigorous out-of-sample validation, and the incorporation of nonlinearities. The authors demonstrate that regularization is crucial for managing model complexity, while the addition of nonlinearities offers limited gains in predictive accuracy. Their methodology aims to accurately predict the full conditional distribution of macroeconomic outcomes, providing a comprehensive view of macroeconomic risk in real time.
