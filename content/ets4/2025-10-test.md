## Pessimism and Inflation: How Firms' Perception of Economic Outlook Shapes Inflation Expectations"
[Link to working paper ↗](https://d.repec.org/n?u=RePEc:tcb:econot:2521&r=&r=mac)

- **Authors:** Okan Akarsu, Altan Aldan, Unal Seven
- **Source:** NEP-MAC (2025-10-17)
- **Summary:** This study investigates how firms' perceptions of their business environment and expectations of future sales influence their inflation forecasts, particularly across different inflation regimes. It reveals that during high-inflation periods, firms' inflation expectations are more closely tied to their assessments of current industry conditions, while in low-inflation periods, expectations about future sales become more significant. This nuanced understanding of expectation formation offers insights into improving inflation forecasting and monetary policy effectiveness, highlighting the importance of reducing macroeconomic uncertainty.

## When Low Rates Speak Loud: exchange rate dynamics under different interest rate regimes
[Link to working paper ↗](https://d.repec.org/n?u=RePEc:bcb:wpaper:630&r=&r=mon)

- **Authors:** Wagner Piazza Gaglianone, Jaqueline Terra Moura Marins, José Valentim Machado Vicente
- **Source:** NEP-MON (2025-10-17)

## Trade War and the Dollar Anchor
[Link to working paper ↗](https://d.repec.org/n?u=RePEc:nbr:nberwo:34332&r=&r=mon)

- **Authors:** Tarek Alexander Hassan, Thomas M. Mertens, Jingye Wang, Tony Zhang
- **Source:** NEP-MON (2025-10-17)
- **Summary:** The paper develops a general-equilibrium model that endogenously determines the safety of a country's currency and its exchange-rate regime, calibrated to pre-2025 data. It forecasts the impact of a trade war on the U.S. dollar's safety premium, interest rates, and the global market value of U.S. firms, suggesting that high tariffs could lead to a shift towards a euro-centric monetary system.
