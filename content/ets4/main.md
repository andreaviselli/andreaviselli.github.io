## 🧠 Methodology of **ets4**

**ets4** combines automation and expert curation to identify and summarize the most relevant new research in **economic forecasting**. 

Every month, the system screens **hundreds of recent working papers** drawn from leading academic and institutional sources — including **NEP (RePEc)**, **arXiv**, and major **central banks** such as the ECB, Federal Reserve, and institutions such as the IMF, BIS, and CEPR.

Behind the scenes, a dedicated Python pipeline manages the entire process:

1. 🛰️ **Data Collection**  
   The pipeline automatically retrieves and parses dozens of RSS feeds that publish newly released working papers in economics, econometrics, finance, and data science.  
   Each feed entry is cleaned, standardized, and time-stamped — only papers from the **past 30 days** are retained for evaluation.

2. 🧩 **AI-Driven Evaluation**  
   For every paper, its title and abstract are sent to a **specialized large language model (LLM)** that evaluates:
   - Whether the paper contains a clear **forecasting or predictive modeling** component.  
   - Its **methodological novelty**, **empirical rigor**, and **potential practical impact**.  
   - Its **applicability to economic forecasting**, even when the paper originates from another field (e.g., machine learning or energy systems).

3. 🧮 **Scoring & Classification**  
   The model assigns a **forecasting relevance score** (1–10) and categorizes each paper as:
   - **Directly Relevant** → Forecasting of economic time series (macroeconomic, financial, or energy).  
   - **Paper of Interest** → Methodological innovation from another domain that could be adapted to economics.  
   - **Not Relevant** → Lacking predictive focus or purely theoretical.  

   Only papers with a **score of 9.0 or higher** are shortlisted for publication in each monthly issue.

4. 🗂️ **Curation & Publication**  
   Shortlisted papers are formatted into two outputs:
   - An **internal version** with detailed scores for review.  
   - A **public issue** with accessible summaries and links to each paper.  
   These are automatically compiled into Markdown and published on this site.

&nbsp;

In short, **ets4** acts as an *AI-assisted research curator* — blending systematic data collection with expert rules and transparent evaluation.

The process ensures that each monthly issue highlights only the most **innovative, empirically grounded**, and **forecast-relevant** contributions emerging from the global research community.
