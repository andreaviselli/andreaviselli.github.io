    <description><![CDATA[The preliminary version of the paper Comparing predictive ability in presence of instability over a very short time, co-authored with my Ph.D. advisors Fabrizio Iacone and Luca Rossini, is now available here.
Abstract
We consider forecast comparison in the presence of instability when this affects only a short period of time. We demonstrate that global tests do not perform well in this case, as they were not designed to capture very short-lived instabilities, and their power vanishes altogether when the magnitude of the shock is very large.]]></description>
