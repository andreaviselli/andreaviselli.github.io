[{"categories":null,"content":" The preliminary version of the paper Comparing predictive ability in presence of instability over a very short time, co-authored with my Ph.D. advisors Fabrizio Iacone and Luca Rossini, is now available here. Abstract We consider forecast comparison in the presence of instability when this affects only a short period of time. We demonstrate that global tests do not perform well in this case, as they were not designed to capture very short-lived instabilities, and their power vanishes altogether when the magnitude of the shock is very large. We then discuss and propose approaches that are more suitable to detect such situations, such as nonparametric methods (S test or MAX procedure). We illustrate these results in different Monte Carlo exercises and in evaluating the nowcast of the quarterly US nominal GDP from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) against a naive benchmark of no growth, over the period that includes the GDP instability brought by the Covid-19 crisis. We recommend that the forecaster should not pool the sample, but exclude the short periods of high local instability from the evaluation exercise.

I expect to defend my doctoral thesis by the end of 2024. I am broadly interested in time series econometrics, forecasting, forecast evaluation, and their application to macroeconomics and energy. More specifically, my doctoral thesis is on nowcasting models, point forecast combinations, and the statistical testing of predictive accuracy with a special focus on the instability brought by the Covid-19 pandemic. In a more recent project, I worked on a Bayesian Markov-switching panel data model for the European electricity markets. In am enthusiast of the potential applications of new types of data for nowcasting, in particular of datasets with mixed sampling frequencies.

The backcasts revise the nowcast for the previous month. Additionally, we offer quarterly nowcasts for the level of GDP and the associated error for the GDP growth nowcast. Monthly updates occur at the end of each month, while quarterly updates are provided at the end of each quarter. Further details on the methodology and the historical nowcast series are available at the end of the page. Monthly Nowcast (Last Update: December 2024) Figure 1: Italian QoQ GDP growth nowcasts and realizations in 2020 chain linked values. Notice that, prior to October 2024, we display pseudo real time nowcasts. The empirical prediction intervals are computed using the history of the nowcast errors (zoom the chart for more details).

Methodological note Nowcasting methods aim to provide the general public -— such as policymakers, media, and investors -— with real-time assessments of critical economic indicators that would otherwise be subject to significant publication delays. In brief, these methods leverage higher-frequency data to forecast indicators that are released less frequently. For example, the quarterly Italian GDP figure is published approximately one and a half months after the reference quarter. This means e.g. the Q1 figure (covering January, February, and March) is only released in mid-April; however, industrial production, which shows a strong correlation with GDP, is released monthly and can be used to nowcast GDP. The econometric methodology used in this report is based on the working paper, Nowcast Combinations in Presence of Instabilities, A. Viselli (2024), which has not yet been disseminated. The code will soon be made publicly available on GitHub. Historical nowcasts Click here to download the historical nowcast series. Notice that the nowcasts prior to October 2024 are not provided as they are derived from an out-of-sample exercise. The latest ISTAT release can be found here.
